# SharePointOnlineOData

I'm trying to use SharePoint Online OData REST API to perform Create/Delete/Read operations without using CSOM package.
This is using Azure AAD to get bearer token.

**All Functionality included**

Should include some batch processing, as it's avilable and it will minimize chatter from app to server, especially when there are multiple operations to perform.
